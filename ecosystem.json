These fees can be allocated towards various purposes based on each individual team's needs and financial model. Baptswap uses an automated market maker (AMM) model, where users can trade against a liquidity pool of two assets, rather than an order book of buy and sell orders. Liquidity providers can earn fees by depositing their tokens into the pool, and traders can swap any token pair supported by the protocol. Baptswap handles the price calculations and slippage adjustments automatically, making trading fast and simple.

In the rapidly evolving world, and web, it is becoming less efficient to simply trust and more crucial to verify everything.  Sign Protocol offers a suite of tools, infrastructure, and standards to create a future where all claims and assertions on the web and the world around us are driven by verifiable attestations.
